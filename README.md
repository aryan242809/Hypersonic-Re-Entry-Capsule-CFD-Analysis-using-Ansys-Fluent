# Hypersonic-Re-Entry-Capsule-CFD-Analysis-using-Ansys-Fluent
This repository contains a detailed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of a hypersonic re-entry capsule using Ansys Fluent. The project simulates high-speed compressible flow around a blunt body for Mach numbers 2, 5, 10, and 17, capturing complex flow phenomena like shock waves, boundary layer behavior, and thermal effects.
